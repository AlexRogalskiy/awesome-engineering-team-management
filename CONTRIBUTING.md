# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome! Here are some guidelines.

- Try to provide an actionable TL;DR as a description, quoting the original text if you need so.

- First level sections are voluntarily not in the alphabetical order: this
list provides a progression to help with the transition to management.

- The rough order is like so:

  1. At first we'll find content appealing to software developers or new managers. We're reaching for accessibility and targets the wider audience and provide a gentle introduction.
  1. Then we can have a couple of real use-cases or anecdotes, which makes the topic more practical.
  1. Third we might add a couple of reference material to generalize concepts, or provide generic solution or broader thinking frameworks.
  1. At the end we'll add the most cynical or bleak content, because hey, we can't help it, at what point things might get ugly in toxic environments. And these content might still have utility as cautionary tales or counter-examples.

- This repository is still in its accumulation phase. Meaning we will not over-think adding stuff to it. The curation phase and fine-tuning can happens in a second time.
