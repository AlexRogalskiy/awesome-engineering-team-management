# Awesome Engineering Team Management

A compilation of advices, anecdotes, knowledge tibits, discussions, return of experience, annotations, industry smalltalks and rants. A bibliography of sort, that I gathered around in the last few years, while transitionning my career from a software engineer to an engineer's manager, and later from a manager to a manager's managers (you all love recursion right? ;) ).

This provides the substrate from which I crafted the contour of my management style, as I found anchoring the later with [the usual labels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_style#Types_of_management_styles) is way too limiting and short-sighted. Limiting as management is both of an art and a science. And short-sighted as a style shouldn't be taken as face-value and always be sensible to our fellow humans talents and the business context of the company.

If built correctly it's genuinely difficult to mess things up.` ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20533922)). I.e. the structure of the organization is quintessential to its longevity.
